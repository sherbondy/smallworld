#The Small World Made Tangible

In this exercise, we:

1. take tiny creatures in the world; viruses, insects, plant seeds, etc.
2. scan them with fancy tools (like SEM or microCT, depending on scale)
3. distinguish different features from the scans (look inside the things!)
4. fabricate giant version of the (life)forms using (fancy multi-material) 3D printers!

Wow, that sounds like a blast, and we might even learn a thing or two.
Let's get started.

Because I am crazy, we are going to try using Julia to express our ideas.

Getting Started:

Let's use ipython notebooks:

```
ipython notebook --profile=julia
```
